![Nightly Build](https://github.com/knightlyjs/knightly/blob/main/res/badge.svg?raw=true)

[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) starter template for the [new `<script setup>` and ref sugar RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/222). Powered by [Knightly](https://github.com/knightlyjs/knightly)

> ⚠️ Please note the feature is currently still in **pending RFC** phrase which means nothing has set in stone yet. This starter template is just for experimenting purposes.


```html
<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue'

ref: count = 0
ref: doubled = computed(() => count * 2)

const inc = () => count++
</script>
```

### Usage

Install the dependencies

> you need to use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.js.org/), `npm` won't work for some reason

```bash
yarn # pnpm i
```

Start the server

```bash
yarn dev # pnpm run dev
```

### Manually

Just update your dependencies and reinstall the packages

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vue": "npm:@knightly/vue@ref-sugar"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "1.0.0-rc.9",
    "@vue/compiler-sfc": "npm:@knightly/vue__compiler-sfc@ref-sugar"
  }
````
